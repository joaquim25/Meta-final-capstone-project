# Little Lemon Restaurant
This is the final capstone project of the META Front-End Developer course available on Coursera. The project is called Little Lemon Restaurant, and it is a detailed and responsive website that allows users to make table bookings.

## Background
Little Lemon Restaurant is a fully-functional website developed as part of the META Front-End Developer program on Coursera. The main objective of the project is to create a restaurant website with a user-friendly interface and booking functionality. The website was built using React, JSX, HTML, and CSS.

## Implementation Details
The project includes five main pages: home, about, menu, reservations and order-online. 
The home page features a spa, wich includes a brief description of the restaurant and a call-to-action button to make a reservation, also displays a list of dishes, which were styled using CSS. The list is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

The reservations page allows users to select a date, time, and number of guests, and then provides feedback to the user regarding their reservation. The booking page was implemented using the Meta front-end table-booking API, which allowed the project to interact with a server to manage the table booking process.

The project also includes a custom 404 error page to handle invalid URLs, a under construction page and a custom favicon for the website.

## Example Usage
To use the website, navigate to the home page and explore the information about the restaurant. Click on the "Reserve a Table" button to navigate to the booking page, where you can select a date, time, and number of guests. After completing the form, click on the "Book Now" button to submit your reservation.

To view the menu, navigate to the menu page using the navigation bar. The page includes a list of dishes with their prices and descriptions.
